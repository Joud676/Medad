**Medad Website**

A platform designed to inspire creativity and support aspiring authors. It allows users to register as Writers or Readers. Writers can bring their stories to life by selecting a cover image, writing content in an e-book format, choosing a genre, and publishing their work to reach a broad audience. In the future, Medad plans to integrate an AI model to help writers improve their skills by checking for spelling and grammar errors. 

Readers can explore a diverse library, sort books by genre, and choose to read them like e-books or listen using a text-to-speech API. By connecting passionate readers and emerging writers, Medad builds a vibrant literary community that celebrates storytelling.
